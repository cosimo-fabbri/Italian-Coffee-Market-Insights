# Impact of Sustainability and Ethics on Customer Behaviours in Italian Domestic Coffee Market - Cluster Analysis using SAS

This project was part of my undergraduate thesis in management and marketing. During my undergraduate studies, I approached the world of statistics and programming for the first time and became fascinated by it. 
That's why I decided to undertake a slightly different thesis, allowing me to apply statistical techniques and use SAS to investigate the impact of ethics and sustainability components on the purchasing behavior of Italian consumers.

I created the survey and analyzed the collected data (more than 200 observations), using cluster analysis methodology (both hierarchical and non-hierarchical), and then profiling the 4 emerged groups.

the analysis was conducted using SAS Studio.

This project presented me with a significant challenge as it was the first time I independently used programming languages, but it taught me a lot. 

I cannot share the database I created due to privacy reasons. However, I'm leaving the questionnaire I devised to understand the starting point.
